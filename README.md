 Analysis of House Prices in Bangalore 

 This Python program is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of property prices in Bangalore based on the `house_price.csv` dataset.
 Opening Google Colab: - 
 Users are guided to access Google Colab, which is a cloud-based platform for executing Python code.
 2.Uploading the Data: -
 The program instructs users to upload their CSV file containing the house price data into Colab.
 3. Loading Libraries and Data: - 
 Essential Python libraries are imported, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`. - The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and basic information about the data is displayed, including structure and summary statistics.
 4. Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): -
 A histogram is created to visualize the distribution of price per square foot, helping to understand the spread of property prices.
 5. Detecting and Removing Outliers: -
 Four different methods are applied to identify and remove outliers in the price per square foot data: -
 Mean and Standard Deviation:
 Points beyond three standard deviations from the mean are removed. -
 Percentile Method:
 The lowest 1% and highest 99% are trimmed off. -
 IQR Method:
 The interquartile range is calculated, and values outside 1.5 times the IQR are filtered out. - 
 Z-Score Method:
 Points with a Z-score above 3 are eliminated.
 6. Visualizing Outliers: -
 A box plot of the original price per square foot data is shown, providing insight into the outliers before any modifications.
 7. Checking Normality: -
 The histogram of the original data is displayed, followed by a log transformation of the price per square foot to normalize the distribution. - The histogram is re-plotted after the transformation to visualize the changes.
 8. Correlation Analysis: -
 A heatmap demonstrates the correlation between numerical features in the dataset, highlighting relationships using a color-coded scale.
 9. Scatter Plot Analysis: - 
 A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between area (in square feet) and price per square foot. This helps to identify any trends or patterns. 
 Conclusion
 This program serves as a guide for anyone interested in exploring real estate data analysis, particularly in Bangalore. It combines practical data manipulation techniques with visualizations, making it a helpful resource for analysts, data scientists, and anyone interested in real estate statistics. By following these steps, users can gain valuable insights into house pricing trends and factors that influence property values in the area.
